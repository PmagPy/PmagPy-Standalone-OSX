# PmagPy-Standalone-OSX
QuickMagIC & Make_magic are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide tools for uploading, downloading, and analyzing data from the MagIC database. For more information on MagIC, see: http://earthref.org/MAGIC/. For complete documentation on using the GUIs, see: http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/.

If you would the full PmagPy functionality, go to: https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy#what-is-it

To get started, download the zip file and put the resulting folder on your desktop. Inside the PmagPy-Standalone folder you will have one folder each for QuickMagIC and MakeMagIC. Open the appropriate folder and double click the icon (depending on your security settings, you may have to right click the icon and then select "ok" the first time you open it).
