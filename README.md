# PmagPy-Standalone-OSX
Pmag GUI & MagIC GUI are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide tools for uploading, downloading, and analyzing data from the MagIC database. For more information on MagIC, see: http://earthref.org/MAGIC/. For complete documentation on using the GUIs, see: http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/.

To get started, download the zip file and put the resulting folder on your desktop. Inside the PmagPy-Standalone folder you will have four files (README.md, licence.txt, magic_gui.app, pmag_gui.app). Double click the app you wish to run (depending on your security settings, you may have to right click the icon and then select "ok" the first time you open it).
