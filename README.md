# PmagPy-Standalone-OSX
Pmag GUI & MagIC GUI are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide tools for uploading, downloading, and analyzing data paleomagnetic data and preparing such data for contribution to the MagIC database. For more information on MagIC, see: http://earthref.org/MAGIC/. For documentation on usage of the GUIs, see: http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/.

If you want full PmagPy functionality beyond what is available in these programs, go to: https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy#what-is-it

To get started with these programs, go to the [latest release](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest).  From there you can download the .zip for Pmag GUI and/or MagIC GUI.  Once downloaded, you can move the program icon to your Desktop, and double click to get started.  If you see an error message like this: '“magic\_gui\_3.11.0.app” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer', you will need to right click the icon and then select "ok" to override OSX security settings.  Lastly, please be patient, as these programs do take a little while to start up!
