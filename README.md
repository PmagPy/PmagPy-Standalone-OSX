# PmagPy-Standalone-OSX
Pmag GUI & MagIC GUI are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide tools for uploading, downloading, and analyzing data from the MagIC database. For more information on MagIC, see: http://earthref.org/MAGIC/. For complete documentation on using the GUIs, see: http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/.

If you would the full PmagPy functionality, go to: https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy#what-is-it

To get started, go to the [latest release](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest).  From there you can download the zipfile for Pmag GUI and/or MagIC GUI.  Once downloaded, you can move the program icon to your Desktop, and double click to get started.  If you see an error message like this: '“magic\_gui\_3.11.0.app” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer', you will need to right click the icon and then select "ok" to override OS X security settings.  Lastly, please be patient, as these programs do take a little while to start up!
