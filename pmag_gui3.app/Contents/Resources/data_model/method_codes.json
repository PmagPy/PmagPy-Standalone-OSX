One expects a changing NRM vector across the heat affected zone of the country rock. When an igneous rock intrudes an older rock formation, the intrusion heats a region of the surrounding country rock and the baked region of the country rock will then cool in the same magnetic field as the intrusion, and so will acquire a direction of magnetization the same as that of the intrusion. Agreement between the direction of magnetization of the intrusion and that of the country rock provides strong evidence for the stability of the magnetization of the intrusion",
